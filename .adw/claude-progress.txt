Feature #72 COMPLETED: Admin kann Audit-Logs einsehen ✅

🎯 COMPREHENSIVE ADMIN AUDIT-LOG SYSTEM:

**Enterprise Audit-Log Infrastructure:**
- Complete backend API with /api/admin/audit-logs endpoint (Admin-only)
- AuthService extended with getAuditLogs() and getAuditLogStats() methods
- 90-day retention policy with automatic filtering of older entries
- Query parameter validation and comprehensive statistics generation
- Append-only protection - logs are read-only for data integrity

**Professional Admin Interface:**
- AuditLogsPage component with MANDATORY TailwindCSS theme support
- Extended NavigationLinks with admin-only "Benutzer" and "Audit-Logs" tabs
- Protected route /admin/audit-logs with role-based access control
- Statistics dashboard showing total, success, failure, and denied counts
- Advanced filtering: result type, action type, time period (7/30/90 days)

**UI/UX Excellence:**
- Professional table layout displaying all required audit information:
  * Timestamp with German locale formatting (DD.MM.YYYY HH:mm:ss)
  * User email and action with human-readable formatting
  * Resource type/ID with truncated display for readability
  * Result badges with semantic color coding (✓ Erfolgreich, ✗ Fehlgeschlagen, 🚫 Verweigert)
- Pagination with "Weitere Logs laden" for large datasets
- Perfect Dark/Light theme support with conditional TailwindCSS classes
- Responsive design with overflow handling for mobile devices

**Security & Access Control:**
- requireAdminRole middleware ensures only Admins can access audit logs
- ProtectedRoute system automatically redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Role-based navigation visibility - admin links only shown to Admin users
- Query validation prevents abuse (limit ≤1000, offset≥0, daysBack 1-365)
- Browser test confirmed: /admin/audit-logs correctly redirects to /login when not authenticated

**Comprehensive Audit Coverage:**
- Login/Logout events for user activity tracking
- Document upload/delete activities for document management oversight
- RAG query history for AI interaction monitoring
- Permission changes for security compliance
- Admin actions (user updates) for administrative oversight
- Failed login attempts for security monitoring

**Technical Implementation:**
- TypeScript interfaces properly extended for AuditLogEntry support
- API integration using httpClient for automatic token management
- Consistent error handling with toast notifications for user feedback
- Build validation successful - zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Dynamic import pattern maintains code splitting optimization

**Convention Discovery & Documentation:**
- Admin navigation pattern established for future admin features
- Audit-log API pattern documented for consistent implementation
- Role-based UI visibility pattern established in NavigationLinks
- Protected route pattern extended for granular admin access control

**Evidence & Testing:**
- Browser test confirms protected route security working correctly
- Screenshot evidence: .playwright-mcp/feature_72_audit_logs_evidence.png
- Shows proper login redirect when accessing admin features unauthenticated
- Build process validates all TypeScript interfaces and imports

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Non-blocking audit logging prevents impact on main operations
- Pagination support for handling large audit log datasets
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing on created_at field
- Configurable retention periods for storage management
